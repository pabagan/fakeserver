# Fake Server
Using:
* [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to create fake endpoints to work with.
* [faker](https://github.com/Marak/faker.js) to create fake content.

Using the same data as in json-server but with some functions to create big amounts of data.

## Run
```sh
yarn start
```
